            <p class="description">According to statistics, since the end of the last ice age 
                10,000 years ago, the world has lost one-third of its forests, 
                equivalent to two billion hectares—twice the size of the
                United States. While deforestation has been occurring for millennia, 
                the rate has significantly increased in recent centuries, 
                with half of the global forest loss happening between 8,000 BCE and 1900, and the other 
                half occurring in the last century. From 2010 to 2020, 
                the net loss of forests was 4.7 million hectares per year, but the actual deforestation rate was much higher, with the UN FAO estimating that 10 million hectares are cut down annually.</p>

            <p>To help reduce deforestation, we can support sustainable products, eat less meat, and promote tree planting. Advocating for strong forest protection laws and raising awareness about the importance of forests also makes a difference. Reducing waste and supporting local communities who protect forests are important steps as well. Together, these actions can help preserve forests and protect our planet.</p>
